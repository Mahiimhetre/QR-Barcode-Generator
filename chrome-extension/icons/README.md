# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any image editor. Recommended:
- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure icons are clear at small sizes
- Use transparent background (PNG format)
- Follow Chrome's icon guidelines

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have icons yet, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use an online icon generator
3. The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome uses default)

## Icon Guidelines

- **16x16**: Should be simple and recognizable
- **48x48**: Can include more detail
- **128x128**: Full detail version for store listing

All icons should represent the CodeCraft brand/functionality (QR codes and barcodes).
